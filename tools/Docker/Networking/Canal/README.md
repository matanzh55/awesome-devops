# Canal

Canal combines Calico and Flannel to provide a straightforward networking + network policy solution for Kubernetes clusters.

## Overview

Canal packages Calico's network policy capabilities with Flannel's simple overlay networking. It's a convenient option where you want Calico policy features but prefer Flannel's overlay dataplane.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Canal manifests are sometimes provided by platform vendors; consult the distro docs
# Example: install Calico then enable Flannel overlay as per project docs
```
