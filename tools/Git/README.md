## Overview

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, using branching and merging strategies. Git's speed, data integrity, and support for distributed workflows make it the most widely used version control system in the world.
